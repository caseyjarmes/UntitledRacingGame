Overview of game and mechanics
-A 3D local multiplayer racing game, created in Unity, with a sci-fi/pirate art style, featuring different tracks and characters
-Tracks branch into several different paths. Spread around these different paths are coins. Coins are also given for coming first in a lap and especially for coming in first in the final lap. Winner is determined by who has the most coins at the end
-Spread around the track are Ammo creates. Collecting an ammo crate allows you to fire a projectile, similar to a shell from Mario Kart. Cars hit by a bullet are stunned briefly and drop a few coins
-There are different cars/racers with unique designs and stats. These different racers have unique victory sprites/quotes and taunt voice lines
